# Text_to_Speech_gTTS
This is a basic code to convert written text into audio using Google's gTTS (google Text To Speech) module.
The user need to input the text he needs to be converted into audio, and the text is converted into an audio
file.
<br>
The input text is converted into an audio file named `file.mp3` in the current directory. To view current directory 
and to change the current directory the steps will be mentioned at the end of this README file.
<br>
<br>
Before beginning with the code make sure you have python installed on your system. If not, head to `python.org` to download
and install it. Make sure to check the `add python to PATH` button during installation.
<br>
After installing python open command prompt and type `pip install gTTS`. This command will install the required module.
<br>
An example audio output file is present in the repository named `file.mp3`.
<br>
<br>
### How to View Current Directory::
Open command prompt and type `cd` and hit enter. This will give you the current directory location. The audio file will get saved
in this location.
<br>
<br>
### How to Change Current Directory::
Open command prompt and tpye: <br>
`cd ..` to go down one level. <br>
`cd /d 'drive_name':` to change the disk. For example, `cd /d E:` changes the current drive to E. <br>
`cd 'required directory location'` to change the current directory to the required directory. For example, `cd C:\Users\Ankit Rana`. <br>
